    "A synchronous generator rotates at some mechanical angular velocity $\\omega_m$, a time derivative of its rotor position (angle):\n",

    "\\frac{d\\theta_m}{dt} = \\omega_m (t) \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where subscript $m$ denotes a mechanical quantity. Although we usually refer all quantities to the electrical side when conducting power system dynamic analyses, we will not do so here. That's because 50 or 60 Hz motion is too fast for the human eye to perceive. Instead, we will use a generator with many poles, reducing the mechanical speed needed to obtain 50 or 60 Hz electrical, and the motion will be nicely visible in the animations.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\omega_m(t)$ depends on the balance between the mechanical torque of the turbine (how much power we are generating) and the generator's electrical load (how much power is consumed by the load connected to the generator). It also depends on the turbine type, load, speed governing mechanism, etc. If the turbine mechanical power in and generator electrical power out is perfectly balanced, the generator rotates at a constant speed. If there is any mismatch between the two, the generator will oscillate.\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\omega_m = \\omega_b^m + \\Delta \\omega^m_\\mathrm{osc} - \\omega^m_\\mathrm{ref} = 2\\pi \\left( f_b^m + \\Delta f^m_\\mathrm{osc} - f^m_\\mathrm{ref} \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Like most continuous dynamic systems, synchronous generators will behave similarly to a second-order system when disturbed, which is a damped sinusoidal behavior. So, we write the speed oscillation function accordingly:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Delta f^m_\\mathrm{osc} = A e^{-Dt} \\sin\\left(2\\pi f^m_\\mathrm{osc}t\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "whre $A$ is the amplitude of oscillations, $D$ is the rate of decay and $f^m_\\mathrm{osc}$ is a constant frequency of rotor oscillations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this ordinary differential equation numerically, we will use the `odeint` function from the `scipy` package. We also need to define the system of differential equations: "
